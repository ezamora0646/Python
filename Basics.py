# Python variables
#same as vectors in R
#strings (chars), floaters (decimals), integers (whole)

string = "Hello World"
print(string)
#even though we have assigned string, we still need to use print

string2 = print("Hello World")
string2 # this approach does not store the string contents bc print doesn't return any values

num1= 66
print(string+str(num1)) #str() coerces data type in python
